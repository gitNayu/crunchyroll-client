###### Unofficial, open-source client implementations for Crunchyroll.

An independent project providing unofficial Crunchyroll API client implementations in multiple programming languages. Designed to make Crunchyroll's API functionality accessible to developers building their own applications and integrations.

## Why Crunchyroll Client?

Interacting with an API directly can mean repeatedly implementing authentication, HTTP requests, response parsing, and error handling.

Crunchyroll Client aims to simplify that process by providing reusable, open-source implementations that handle these details for you.

- Easy integration – Use existing client functionality instead of implementing everything yourself.

- Structured data – Work with organized API responses.

- Multiple languages – Choose between Python and TypeScript.

- Flexible usage – Integrate the client into your own applications and workflows.

- Open source – Inspect, modify, and contribute to the implementations.

- Spend less time implementing API interactions and more time building your application.

## Disclaimer
This is an independent, **unofficial project**. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with *Crunchyroll, LLC*.
Crunchyroll is a trademark of its respective owner.

### Third-Party Usage and Responsibility

This project is provided as an unofficial API client for development, interoperability, and independent application integrations.

I do not endorse, support, maintain, or take responsibility for third-party repositories, applications, or modifications that use this client to download, redistribute, or otherwise obtain Crunchyroll content without authorization.

The existence of this client does not imply approval of such projects or their functionality. Third-party developers are solely responsible for their own implementations and how they use this software.

I reserve the right to distance this project from third-party uses that conflict with its intended purpose.

### Python Client
The Python implementation is the primary reference client.

**Repository:** [gitNayu/cr-client-py](https://github.com/gitNayu/cr-client-py)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitNayu/cr-client-py.git
cd cr-client-py
pip install .
```

### Keys and Authorization

**This project does not ship any keys, secrets, tokens, or other authorization data.** You must provide your own.

- No client keys or client secrets are included in this repository.
- No account logins or tokens are included.
- You are responsible for how you get and use your keys, and for following the terms of the service.

#### Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `keys.env`.
2. Add one line per client, in this format:

   ```
   NAME=base64(key:secret)
   ```

   `NAME` can be any name you choose.

3. Set `ACTIVE` to the name of the key you want to use.

Example `keys.env` (fake values):

```
ACTIVE=ANDROID_TV
ANDROID_TV=a2V5OnNlY3JldA==
ANDROID_PHONE=b3RoZXJrZXk6b3RoZXJzZWNyZXQ=
```

To make the base64 value:

```bash
python3 -c "import base64; print(base64.b64encode(b'key:secret').decode())"
```

Never commit `keys.env`. It is listed in `.gitignore`. Base64 is not encryption, so keep the file private.

### TypeScript Client
Coming Soon..

### Quick Start

```python
from cr_client_py import Crunchyroll

cr = Crunchyroll()  # no account needed

# 1. Search
hits, key = cr.search('Spy x Family')
series_id = hits[0]['id']

# 2. Get all metadata (every language)
meta, key = cr.get_series_metadata(series_id, episodes=False)
print(meta['localized']['en-US']['title'])

# 3. Get image URLs
urls, key = cr.get_image_urls(meta)
print(urls['images'].get('poster_tall'))

# 4. See which client key was used
print(key.label)
```

Every function returns `(data, key)`. The library only returns data and URLs. It does not save files or download images.
